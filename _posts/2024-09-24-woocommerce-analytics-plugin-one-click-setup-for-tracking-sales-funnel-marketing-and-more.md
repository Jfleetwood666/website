Tracking the performance of your WooCommerce store doesn't have to be complicated. In fact, it's incredibly straightforward with the Plausible plugin for WordPress, allowing you to set up end-to-end ecommerce site monitoring with just one click.

You will be able to track most ecommerce analytics, right on your WordPress dashboard (or Plausible dashboard, if you prefer). Analytics like:

* Which products sell the most and the least, and why?
* Which marketing channels generate the highest traffic and sales—search, social media, email, ads, or someplace else—so you can focus your efforts on the most effective ones.
* User behavior to spot where your website loses potential revenue.
* Total sales and revenue by category, over time.
* Average order value (AOV).
* Refund and return rates, cart abandonment rates and recovery opportunities.
* How many unique visitors visit the store and how much time do they spend there.
* Conversion rates such as the percentage of visitors who make a purchase, or wishlist a particular product type, or conversion rates by traffic source.
* Buyer journeys, i.e. how customers move from finding your store to checking out (funnel analysis).
* Fast-moving vs. slow-moving products.
* Where your customers are located geographically and which regions show demand for specific products.

…and more.

Such insights can help you learn better about your customer behavior, optimize your marketing and customer experience, improve product offerings, optimize the website, and maximize sales and revenue.

Or in other words, they help you get a birds-eye view of all the possible data to improve your ecommerce site’s performance.

P.S. You can take a quick look at [Plausible’s live demo](https://plausible.io/plausible.io), where we show our own website’s real stats, to see what you’ll get in an active Plausible dashboard.

## How does Plausible Analytics compare to Google Analytics for WooCommerce tracking?

Traditionally, Google Analytics has been the go-to tool for this purpose. But it requires a deeply technical and complex setup, loses a lot of accurate data due to being blocked by many ad blockers, missing bot protection and consent banner declines, and is [not GDPR-compliant](https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-gdpr). 

Plausible Analytics is a powerful alternative that is lightweight, easy to use, and privacy-friendly.

Let’s see:

### Easy vs complex setup and analysis, for the same insights

On visiting the official [Google Analytics for WooCommerce plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/reviews/) page, you will find many recent reviews of how the new version hasn’t been working for months, how it slows down the WooCommerce site, doesn’t even integrate well with GA4, is not compliant with GDPR, etc.

They have an average rating of 2.8 stars:

On the other hand, the official [Plausible plugin page](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/plausible-analytics/reviews/) is used on more than 10k WordPress sites, with an average rating of 4.9 stars:

\
This means that if Google Analytics 4 is your choice, you will need to manually set everything up since its WooCommerce plugin is not reliable.

And a manual [Google Analytics 4 setup for ecommerce](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/ecommerce?client_type=gtag) typically involves collaborating with a developer to send necessary ecommerce events (eg: "purchase"), text and numerical parameters (eg: “currency”, “transaction-ID”, “coupon”, etc.) to the data layer in Google Tag Manager (while taking care of character limits), followed by testing everything through the DebugView, configuring events, custom dimensions, metrics, etc. in the GA4 UI, and even building your reports from scratch using the Free Form functionality. Phew.

We, at Plausible, know pretty much about web analytics and even we wouldn't want to do all that. That, by the way, is [why we built Plausible](https://plausible.io/blog/the-analytics-tool-i-want) in the first place.
