Wï»¿e have migrated from Shopify's deprecated "Additional scripts" feature to the new "Pixels" setup. This ensures a much easier and efficient tracking of e-commerce events moving forward.

You can now effortlessly track checkout pages and customer events like site searches, adds-to-cart, started checkouts, purchases, etc. on Shopify. Simply copy and paste our pre-built code blocks into your Shopify store. Visit our [documentation](https://plausible.io/docs/shopify-integration) to get started.
