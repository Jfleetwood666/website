The one thing that has always helped Plausible grow is sticking to the needs of a specific set of audience. When we started as a simple-enough and privacy-first way of tracking website traffic, we automatically started appealing to individual creators.

As we grew and improved our tech and product, and stuck with our philosophy of rejecting surveillance capitalism while providing a really easy, but useful, tool to use –– we noticed an uptick in the customer base that were small startups and tech founders.

This clarity helped us steer the product and business decisions –– like which features to build on priority, what pricing to set, etc. –– in the right direction.

It’s been six good years in business and we understand the importance of data that can answer the single-most important question to businesses, whether they are new or evolving, “Who is our audience?”

It makes sense to analyze your website traffic to understand such insights since it’s a fair presumption that both existing customers and potential customers must have visited your website at some point, at the very least.

While Plausible anyway gives you basic and reliable data on visitor traffic, it can come in hundreds or millions of numbers. Either way, it is next to impossible to make meaningful sense of it without creating some subgroups that can be studied.

That is audience segmentation in a nutshell, i.e. when you filter out your available website visitors’ data to create “segments” that can be studied to answer meaningful business questions and take defining decisions and/or create marketing strategies.

The use cases and depths of analyses can greatly vary though. Say, an independent journalist may want to know about the number of unique visitors to their website, segmented by cities they get in a month and a year. This clarity could help them personalize their research work, language and writing style to the cities that show the most interest in their work.

Similarly, a SaaS business team may have additional requirements and could want to know about the audience segments taking specific actions on their site and converting. They could also want to drill further into that to understand which channels such converting audiences typically came from in a given period of time.

Whereas, a large e-commerce platform might be interested in tracking complete, detailed customer journeys, from initial product views to final purchases, across different product categories and marketing campaigns.

The interesting thing to note is that if you are in business, you’d definitely be having some audience segments –– whether you are aware of them yet or not. It’s worth exploring them.

So, let’s understand how and what a web analytics tool can tell you about your segments of audiences.

## What a web analytics tool can reveal about audience segmentation

No matter the depth of analysis needed, any segment is built with a mix and match of the three basic questions:

* How did the audience find us (channels of acquisition, marketing campaigns)?
* What they were like (devices used, locations they live in)?
* What they did on the site (pages visited, actions taken, conversions met, etc.)?

In a web analytics dashboard, like Plausible or Google Analytics, these common audience insights take the shape of:

* Geographic segmentation
* Traffic Acquisition segmentation
* Technological segmentation: devices, browser, OS data
* Behavioral segmentation: Page views, events and engagement data

This eventually helps build answers to important business questions. For eg. “How many visitors from the United States signed up last year?” or “Is our site more popular with mobile users or desktop users in Germany?” or “Do the visitors reaching our site from X (Twitter) visit the pages we want them to?”

 

By answering such questions, you can make decisions based on real data. Say, you identify that, for your e-commerce store, the mobile traffic has seen a spike in the last six months while the cart abandonment has been high too. You may want to consider creating a cutting-edge mobile app.

 

Or say, you discover that traffic from UAE has shown a lot of interest in a new feature you had launched. Then, you might want to target your marketing campaigns towards that audience.

 

But answering such questions first requires breaking the available audience data into segments so that they can be analyzed to answer such questions.

 

Continuing the example from above, if you could access the segments of UAE visitors AND the landing pages they visit the most when they arrive at your website, you could join these data sets to answer specific questions or discover new and valuable insights.

 

In Plausible, this is as easy and quick as applying a few filters on your simple, elegant, single-page dashboard.

## How to segment the audience in your Plausible dashboard?  

In Plausible, your audience data is already presented in basic segments like channels of acquisition, landing pages they visit, the locations they come from, and the devices they use. This is all done by default, out-of-the-box.

 When you have a Plausible dashboard open, clicking on any entry (or entries) filters the dashboard to show only the data pertaining to [those](https://plausible.io/plausible.io?filters=((is,country,(US)),(is_not,region,(US-CO,US-MN,US-AZ)),(is,goal,(Visit%2B/register)))&labels=(US:United%2BStates,US-CO:Colorado,US-MN:Minnesota,US-AZ:Arizona)) filters.

If you don’t have a Plausible Analytics account yet, you can play around with [our live demo](https://plausible.io/plausible.io) where our own website’s real data is publicly available. The following examples are fetched from the same dashboard, and you can try the explained filters for yourself on the live demo.

### Example: Free Trial visitors from Twitter, USA (excluding CO, MN, AZ)  

If we wanted to segment the audience that came to our [Free Trial registration page](https://plausible.io/register), from Twitter, from the USA (but excluding the regions of Colorado, Minnesota and Arizona – maybe because we ran paid ads in those regions and only want to understand organic traffic), in the year so far, then we would get this:
